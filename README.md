# pop-it
Pytho code for a fun game inspired by the popular colorful Pop It fidget toy, a trendy stress-relief accessory that has captured the attention of both kids and adults alike. 

Two players will iteratively choose a row and remove as many objects as they wish.

The one who makes the partner to remove the last one is the winner

I discovered it is more or less same as NIM game that you can find while browing
